THIS IS TO GUIDE YOU TO GETTING AND REPRODUCING YOUR RESULTS: 


You must operate from the root directory of the repository. Directories outputs, visualisations, and plots need to be one level below you. 

The mentioned directories need to exist. 



GRAPHS FOR RAINFALL MODEL (folders A to D),

	you need files in the :
				reflectivity_profile.txt,
				reflectivity_profile_avg.txt,
				reflectivity_profile_1min.txt,
				reflectivity_profile_5min.txt,
				reflectivity_profile_avg_1min.txt,
				reflectivity_profile_avg_5min.txt,
				Breflectivity_profile_avg_1min.txt,
				Creflectivity_profile_avg_1min.txt,

				vpr_stages.txt
				vpr_comparison.txt


	you need to edit and run the following test files in the tests/ folder:

				test_VPR.c



	instructions for:

				reflectivity_profileXXXX.txt
						
						comment all blocks in the VPR file
							
						uncomment block 2 in the test_VPR.c file. 

						Ensure the right VPR parameters are set. 

						Ensure the right height samples for the reolution in the graphs. 

						Ensure the correct timesteps for the 1 min and 5 min files. 
							The minuteless files are at a 5min resolution. 

						Once the right parameters are set, run the test file. 

						CHANGE the filename to the right name to match the needed files above. 


				reflectivity_profile_avgXXXXX.txt 

						comment all blocks in the VPR file
						
						uncomment block 5 in the test_VPR.c file.

						Ensure ALL the right parameters are set. Like above. 

						Ensure the number of sample points are correct too. Change the time interval for this as well. 

						Once the right parameters are set, run the file. 

						Change the filename to the right name to match the needed files above. 

				vpr_stages.txt and vpr_comparison.txt:

						commend all blocks in the VPR file

						uncomment block 3 in the test_VPR.c file

						ensure the right VPR parameters are set. 

						change the height resolution and other height information if so desired. 

						once satisfied, run the file. 

						the filenames should be correct.

	GETTING to the graphs: 	

				A: run $ python visualisations/VPR_SoT_RR.py

				B: run $ python visualisations/plot_vpr_comparison_normalised_individual.py

				C: run $ python visualisations/instant_v_running.py

				D: run $ python visualisations/communication_rate_test_copy.py
				  AND
				   run $ python visualisations/communication_rate_tests_1mins_copy.py




CARTESIAN FORM OF RADAR IMAGES:


	You need the following files: 
					radar_scans.txt
					*_catesian_grid_output_*.txt 
						m_ , h_ , or a_ as possible prefixes
						_(number) for the scan number/id.
						for each scan number you will need all three forms (m, h and a).

	you need to edit and run the following test files in the tests/ folder:

				test_radar.c
				test_processing.c



	instructions for:

					radar_scans.txt

						IN test_radar.c						

						set the radar parameters to your likining:
							scanning type, location and height in reference plane, max resolution and rnage resolution. and angular resolution.
						
						set your raincell parameters (these still will change) in create_raincell() function. 

						define the radar motion in create_spatial_raincell() function. 
	
						Determine the sampling times for the radar  by changing the time parameter in teh first for loop. 

						run the test file test_radar.c


					*_cartesian_grid_output_*.txt

						IN test_processing.c

						set the target_radar_id to the right id... otherwise there will be no output. 

						set the cartesian grid resolution as you like. 

						fun the test file test_processing.c

	Getting to the graphs:

		The graphs are either the attenuation ("amount" of attenuation), the height of the radar beam, or which part of the raincell the radar sampled from. 
	
			For the graph in polar coordinates (based on the radar_scans.txt): 

				run $ python visualisations/plotpolarpointdata.py 
						THEN select the radar_scans.txt file with the number. 

			For the attenuation, height and sampling plots in cartesian coordinates
				run $ python visualisations/plot_cartesian_grid2.py

		The plots can be found in the plots folder in the repository. 				







RUNNING TESTS:
			
	Ensure you are in the base folder (Repo).

	run $ make test
	
		THEN the available tests will be listed, pick one using the number pad.
